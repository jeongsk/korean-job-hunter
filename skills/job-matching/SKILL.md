# Job Matching Skill v3.7 (EXP-096: Dart↔Flutter + Angular↔TypeScript TIER2)

## Score Weights (Validated — EXP-017)

| Component | Weight | Score Range | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Skill match** | **35%** | 0-100 | Core skill alignment with tiered matching |
| **Experience fit** | **25%** | 0-100 | Career stage and experience level alignment |
| **Company culture fit** | **15%** | 0-100 | Cultural values and work environment matching |
| **Career stage alignment** | **15%** | 0-100 | Professional development stage compatibility |
| **Location/work/salary/employment fit** | **10%** | 0-100 | Work type, location, salary preference, and employment type alignment |

## Discrimination Requirements (EXP-028)

After scoring, these rules must hold:
- **HIGH** group: score ≥ 70
- **MEDIUM** group: score ≤ 65
- **HIGH min − MED max** gap ≥ 15
- **LOW** group: score ≤ 25

## Skill-Gated Scoring (EXP-021, tuned EXP-037)

When skill score < 40, all non-skill components are dampened by a quadratic gate multiplier:
- Multiplier = `(skillScore / 40)²`, minimum 0.04
- At skill=0: gate=0.04, skill=10: gate=0.0625, skill=20: gate=0.25, skill=40: gate=1.0
- This prevents unrelated jobs from scoring high on experience/culture/location alone
- Experience scoring considers range upper bounds (e.g., "3~7년" with 5 years experience = 95)

## Primary Domain Alignment (EXP-024, tuned EXP-037)

When the job's primary technology stack has zero overlap with the candidate's core domain skills, the skill score is penalized by **40%** (multiplied by 0.60).

Primary domains detected (EXP-049: framework-aware):
- **Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust, Swift, C++, C#, Kotlin, Dart, Ruby, PHP
- **Frameworks map to parent language**: Spring/Spring Boot→Java, Django/Flask/FastAPI→Python, React/Next.js/Vue/Nuxt.js/Svelte/Express/NestJS/Node.js→JS/TS, Flutter→Dart, Laravel→PHP, Rails→Ruby, SwiftUI→Swift, .NET/ASP.NET→C#

This prevents infrastructure-only overlap (AWS, Docker, PostgreSQL) from inflating scores for jobs in completely different primary tech stacks. Framework-only job listings (e.g., `[Spring, MySQL]` with no raw `Java` keyword) now correctly trigger domain alignment.

## Job Intent Classification

Categorize job postings by technical domain:
- **Development**: 개발, development, engineer, programmer
- **Data**: 데이터, data, analytics, AI/ML
- **Management**: 매니저, manager, leader, pm
- **Design**: 디자인, design, ui/ux
- **Sales**: 영업, sales, business development
- **Research**: 연구, research, scientist, r&d

## Company Culture Keywords (EXP-043, EXP-048)

Culture keywords are extracted from job listing text by the scraper (see `skills/job-scraping/SKILL.md`):
- **Innovative**: 혁신, 도전, 창의, 크리에이티브, creative, innovation, 실험, experiment
- **Collaborative**: 협업, 팀워크, 소통, 협력, collaborat*, teamwork, 함께, 공동, 수평적, 가로형, 크로스 펑셔널
- **Fast-paced**: 빠른, agile, 실시간, 스타트업, fast-paced, 릴리즈, 스프린트, sprint
- **Structured**: 체계, 프로세스, systematic, QA, 품질관리, 코드리뷰, code review, 가이드라인
- **Learning-focused**: 성장, 학습, learning, 교육, 스터디, 멘토링, 세미나, 사내강의, 도서지원
- **Autonomous**: 자율, 독립, autonomous, 자기주도, 오너십, 자유도, 주도적
- **Work-life balance**: 워라밸, 워크라이프밸런스, WLB, 유연근무, 시차출근, 자유출퇴근, 연차, 리프레시, 가족친화

When `culture_keywords` is empty/null, culture score defaults to 50 (neutral). When present, score is based on overlap with candidate's `cultural_preferences`. Unknown experience, career_stage, and location/work_type also default to 50 — missing data should not inflate scores (EXP-051).

## Experience Scoring (EXP-076)

| Job Experience | Candidate Years | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `신입` | 0-1 | 95 | Perfect: new graduate |
| `신입` | 2-3 | 65 | Junior: overqualified |
| `신입` | 4+ | 40 | Senior: poor fit |
| `신입·경력` / `신입/경력` | any | 85 | Both welcome — broad match |
| `경력무관` | any | 80 | Experience not a factor |
| `3~7년` | 5 | 95 | In range |
| `3년 이상` | 5 | 90 | Meets minimum |
| `3년 이상` | 2 | 70 | Below minimum |
| unknown | any | 50 | Neutral default |

## Title-Based Skill Inference (EXP-052)

When `job.skills` is empty or has <2 entries (common from LinkedIn/partial scrapes), explicit technology keywords are extracted from the job title to improve matching accuracy.

**Rules:**
- Only extract **explicit technology mentions** (React, Java, Python, etc.) — do NOT infer from role names
- Korean equivalents supported: 리액트→React, 파이썬→Python, 스프링→Spring, etc.
- Title-inferred skills **supplement** (not replace) explicit skills
- Not used when `job.skills` already has ≥2 entries

**Example:** A job with `title: "React/TypeScript 프론트엔드"` and `skills: []` gets effective skills `[React, TypeScript]` — matching score reflects actual domain alignment instead of defaulting to neutral 50.

**Discrimination impact:** Without title inference, a React job with no skills and a Java job with no skills both score ~50. With inference, the React job scores HIGH and the Java job scores LOW for a JS candidate — correct discrimination is restored.

## Salary Preference Alignment (EXP-084)

The 10% Location/Work/Salary component now includes salary preference matching when both the candidate has `preferences.salary_range: {min, max}` and the job has `salary_min`/`salary_max` populated.

**Scoring breakdown** (base 50):
- Location match: +15
- Work type match: +15
- Salary alignment: -20 to +20
- Employment type alignment: -15 to +5 (EXP-085)

## Employment Type Alignment (EXP-085)

Jobs are classified by `employment_type`: `regular` (정규직, default), `contract` (계약직/파견), `intern` (인턴), `freelance` (프리랜서). All three post-processors extract this field.

**Scoring:**
- **Match with candidate preference**: +5
- **Contract job, candidate doesn't want contract**: -10
- **Intern job, candidate doesn't want intern**: -15
- **No preference specified or no employment_type**: neutral (0)

Backward compatible — jobs without employment_type data score neutrally.

**Salary alignment logic:**
- **Ranges overlap**: +5 to +20 (proportional to overlap ratio)
- **Job below candidate min**: -5 to -20 (proportional to gap)
- **Job above candidate max**: +5 (slight positive — above expectations is acceptable)
- **No salary data on either side**: 0 (neutral, backward compatible)

**Example:** Candidate wants 5000-8000만원. Job offering 6000-7000 → good overlap (+10). Job offering 2500-3500 → below range (-11). Job offering 9000-12000 → above range (+5).

This prevents a 3000만원 job from scoring identically to a 7000만원 job when the candidate explicitly prefers 5000-8000.

## Matching Workflow

1. **Parse job** → extract skills, experience range, culture keywords, work type, location
2. **Load candidate** → from `data/resume/master.yaml` (skill_summary, experience_years, career_stage, preferences, cultural_preferences)
3. **Score each component** using weights above, with skill-gate and domain alignment adjustments
4. **Verify discrimination** — HIGH/MED/LOW groups must satisfy gap requirements
5. **Output match report** with scores, matched/missing skills, and recommendations
